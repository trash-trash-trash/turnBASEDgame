TODO: allow player to customise party order

If the Player collides with a NPC with FightStarter, both FightStarters set the current Party (list of PartyScriptableObjects) in the BattleManager singleton, which serves as a middleman between overworld movement and turn-based battle scenes.

-- The Player and NPCs can now start fights

-- Starting a fight loads the turn-based scene and sets it to Active, ending the turn-based scene unloads it and set OverworldScene to Active

-- NPCs change their dialogue and behavior upon death
